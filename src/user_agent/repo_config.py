"""Discover and read agent configuration files from the task repository.

Scans the working directory inside the Docker container for well-known
config files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .claude/, .ai/, .cursor/, etc.)
and returns their concatenated contents for injection into agent prompts.

This ensures all agents get the same repo context regardless of whether
they natively auto-discover these files (e.g., Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md
automatically, but Terminus2 and Codex do not).
